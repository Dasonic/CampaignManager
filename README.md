# CampaignManager

This application is designed to be used to help a game master manage the world for tabletop RPG campaigns.
The game master will be able to add notes and markers onto the map, which will be saved and displayed at the selected point on the map, making referring to notes for nearby locations and events easy. You no longer have to remember the names of the nearby locations to look at their notes! 

This application is made using JavaFX and FXML.
